# Marky

A hierarchially organised Markbook-based notebook. The aim is to differentiate from the swathes of other note taking
apps by making organisation of notes as easy, recognisable and accessible as possible. Markdown was also selected due
to its simplicity, ubiquity and ability to be converted into other formats.
